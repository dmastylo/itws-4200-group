            li 1. Game starts when there are 2 players on each side.
            li 2. Bumping into an opposing player that is on your side will "tag" them and teleport them back to their side of the field, where they'll remain until they heal.
            li 3. Bumping into the flag will pick it up and attach it to the player.
            li 4. Bringing it back to their side will score a point for the team. 
            li 5. Once time runs out, the game is won by the team with the highest score.

            li 2. Bumping into the flag will pick it up and attach it to the player.
            li 3. Bringing it back to their flag spawn will score a point for the team. 
            li
              | 4. After 2 minutes the game ends and the team with more points wins!
